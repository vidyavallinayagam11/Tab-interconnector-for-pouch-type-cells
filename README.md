PCB based Tab interconnector for 5S 1P pouch type cells
📌 Lithium-Ion Battery Pack Interconnector PCB  

This repository contains the PCB design for a 5S 1P pouch-type lithium-ion battery pack interconnector.  
The project aims to improve battery pack reliability by enabling the use of remaining functional cells when one cell fails.  

🔋 Project Overview  
🔹 Designed for 5S 1P pouch-type lithium-ion cells
🔹 Max Voltage: 21V (4.2V per cell)  
🔹 Nominal Voltage: 18.5V (3.7V per cell)  
🔹 Max Discharge Current: 140A
